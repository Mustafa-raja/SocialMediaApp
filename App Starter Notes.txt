About Application :

A social media application with very basic functionality (since we had two days to develop and understand some concepts):
- The application allows you to register and login as a user:
-You can post your thoughts on the application.
-You can post/Update your bio.
-You can Update/Delete your existing post.
-You like/unlike posts of the users you follow as well as your posts.
-You comment on posts of the users you follow as well as your posts.
-The app lets you search from all the users in the website, where you can follow/unfollow the users.
And some more.

—— The application is built in two components a RESTapi and a React frontEnd, they are loosely coupled and only talk to each other using the api Mappings——
